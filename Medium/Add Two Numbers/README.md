# Medium - Add Two Numbers

- need to multiply each digit by factor of 10 for each linked list part
- could we this do recursively?
- recursively call function
    - base case: next node in list is null
    - return 0?
    - for each call, increase multiplication factor
        - 1, 10, 100, 1000, &c.
