# Easy - Longest Common Prefix

---

this problem has taught me the importance of recognizing when it's best to start top down or bottom up. if we started bottom up, it would take much longer than necessary. when starting top down, we can take the first string and compare each element with the next string, then return the found prefix for those two strings, and continue on for any input n strings.
