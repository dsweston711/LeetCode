# LeetCode Practice – C++

Structured problem-solving practice using C++.

## Structure
Problems are organized by difficulty:
- `/Easy/`
- `/Medium/`
- `/Hard/`

Each folder includes:
- One or more solutions (`.cpp`)
- A problem-specific `README.md` explaining the approach
- A `Makefile` for compilation

## Sample Topics
- Binary Search
- Two Pointers
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- String Manipulation

---

This repo reflects focused algorithmic training and problem decomposition using C++.
