# LeetCode Practice â€“ C++

Structured problem-solving practice using C++.

## Structure

Problems are organized by difficulty:

- `/Easy/`
- `/Medium/`
- `/Hard/`

Each folder includes:

- One or more solutions (`.cpp`)
- A problem-specific `README.md` explaining the approach
- A `Makefile` for compilation

## Sample Topics

- Binary Search
- Two Pointers
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- String Manipulation

---

This repo reflects focused algorithmic training and problem decomposition using C++.

> Note: Some problems are still in progress or missing writeups. This repository is updated over time as I revisit or re-implement solutions.
